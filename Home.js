    React makes building web applications seamless and provides a robust developer experience throught reusable components. They make it easier to track and fix bugs, make updates, and maintain code bases as they grow in scale and complexity.<br/>
    <br/>
    React is used for creating interactive UIs. You can use React to build dynamic interfaces for single page web applications, cross-platform mobile apps, data visualization tools, and more.<br/>
     <br/>
    One of the main benefits of using React JS is its potential to reuse components. it saves time for developers as they don't have to write various code for the same features. Furtheremore, if any changes are made in any particular part, it will not affect other parts of the application.
